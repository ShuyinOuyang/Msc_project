The taste you love has always come from oats that are naturally gluten free. We're simply making sure they stay that way. When Phil, a member of the Cheerios team for over 50 years, found out his daughter-in-law couldn't eat gluten, he knew his team had to find a way to make sure every family, including his, could share breakfast together. We know there are lots of families out there who don't want to let dietary restrictions get in the way of time together. Now that Cheerios are gluten free, more families than ever can sit down to share breakfast, and we couldn't be happier. After all, bringing families together around the breakfast table is exactly why we're here.",

The taste you love has always come from oats that are naturally gluten free. We're simply making sure they stay that way. When Phil, a member of the Cheerios team for over 50 years, found out his daughter-in-law couldn't eat gluten, he knew his team had to find a way to make sure every family, including his, could share breakfast together. We know there are lots of families out there who don't want to let dietary restrictions get in the way of time together. Now that Cheerios are gluten free, more families than ever can sit down to share breakfast, and we couldn't be happier.
